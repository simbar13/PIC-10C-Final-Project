# PIC-10C-Final-Project

## My plan for this project: create code that keeps track of ones budget, diet/exercise, schedule etc.

My original plan for this project was to create a QT application that allows the user to input their finance, schedule, and fitness information via an easy to use GUI.  The goal was that this data would be saved and then allowed to be continously updated at the users discretion, and the widget would then tell the user steps to take in order to reach certain goals.

Unfortunately, I don't think I will be able to set up the QT interface, and will most likely finish with a version of this that is meant to be used in Visual C++ or some other standard compiler.  I don't know yet how well it will be able to save data, I am thinking that each iteration generates a txt file (like assignment 1) that contains the input you put in for the next iteration to make changes to whatever you have.
