# PIC-10C-Final-Project

## My plan for this project: create code that keeps track of ones budget, diet/exercise, schedule etc.

My original plan for this project was to create a QT application that allows the user to input their finance, schedule, and fitness information via an easy to use GUI.  The goal was that this data would be saved and then allowed to be continously updated at the users discretion, and the widget would then tell the user steps to take in order to reach certain goals.

Unfortunately, I don't think I will be able to set up the QT interface, and will most likely finish with a version of this that is meant to be used in Visual C++ or some other standard compiler.  I don't know yet how well it will be able to save data.

I am going to continue to work on this project in the coming couple weeks (currently 06/09/2020).  I do not know if a final working version will be ready by the time this project is meant to be graded, but I will hopefully have it working soon.  As of today, the user can generate their tracker by inputting their data, I am going to work on saving data/updating data in parallel with studying for the final.  

Latest update (6/9/2020): user can succesfully create their tracker, options to update/view stats and goals are WIP.  There is a compiling program that will achieve at least some of the goal functionality.  Next steps: finish update/view options, improve UI, save data more efficiently.
